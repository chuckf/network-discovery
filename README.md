network-discovery
=================

Scripts I'm writing to learn Python. Taking as much from libraries as I can. Obviously a lesson in regex is a very good idea, but lots of examples available on the internets.

1st stage:
Python script that will ping a range of IP addresses

2nd stage:
Python script everse DNS lookup on a range IP addresses

3rd stage:
Scrape a web page for links
